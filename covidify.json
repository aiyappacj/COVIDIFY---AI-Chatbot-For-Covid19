Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries\nhave succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.\n\nYou can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\n-> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-\nbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using\nalcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n-> Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\nWhy? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n-> Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.\nOnce contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,\nnose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and\ncan make you sick. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. \n"

If you have a fever, cough and\ndifficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.\nWhy? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\nKeep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). \n\n->If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.\nWhy? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.\n\n\nPROTECTON MEASURES FOR PERSONS WHO ARE IN OR HAVE RECENTLY VISITED (PAST\n14 DAYS) AREAS WHERE COVID-19 IS SPREADING :\n\nFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for\neveryone)\n\n-> Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.\nWhy? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.\n\n-> If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek\nmedical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory\ninfection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.\nWhy? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to\nquickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."

Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries\nhave succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.\n\nYou can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\n-> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-\nbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using\nalcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n-> Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\nWhy? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n-> Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.\nOnce contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,\nnose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and\ncan make you sick. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. \n"

If you have a fever, cough and\ndifficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.\nWhy? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\nKeep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). \n\n->If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.\nWhy? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.\n\n\nPROTECTON MEASURES FOR PERSONS WHO ARE IN OR HAVE RECENTLY VISITED (PAST\n14 DAYS) AREAS WHERE COVID-19 IS SPREADING :\n\nFollow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for\neveryone)\n\n-> Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.\nWhy? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.\n\n-> If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek\nmedical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory\ninfection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.\nWhy? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to\nquickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."
